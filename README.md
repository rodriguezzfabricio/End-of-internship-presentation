Hi all,

This meeting will be dedicated to your end of term presentations.  As a reminder, here are some instructions for your presentations, and I’ve linked the FINRA-branded PPT templates you can use.  Keep in mind, you can add or delete as many slides as you’d like, the template is just for branding like fonts, colors, etc. 

o	Please put together a 2-3 minute PowerPoint on what you’ve worked on during your time here at FINRA. 
o	You can include:
o	What value you’ll take away from your experience; demo of the tool or application you are currently using; what you’ve learned, etc. 
o	You’ll be presenting to your cohort’s managers and mentors!
o	Please use the presentation template linked here for font, colors, etc.  – you can use as many or as few slides as you’d like
o	Feel free to partner up if you have other team members who are working on the same projects or team as you.
o	Please keep this to only 2-3 minutes max so we have enough time for everyone to present!
